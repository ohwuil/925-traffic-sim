# Smart Transportation System Simulation

## Overview

This project simulates a personal rapid transit system with self-driving cars, focusing on station placements and user accessibility. The simulation uses real-time visualization to display the movement of cars between various stations and calculates travel and wait times for each rider.

## Features

- Simulates car movements between predefined stations.
- Provides real-time updates and visualization using p5.js and Leaflet.
- Calculates and displays travel times and wait times for each rider.
- Updates the map dynamically to show car movements.
- Station markers change color based on ride status:
  - Yellow when a ride is waiting.
  - Red when a ride is in progress.
  - Blue when a ride is completed.

## Installation
